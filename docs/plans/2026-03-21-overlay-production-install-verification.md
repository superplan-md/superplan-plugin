# Overlay Production Install Verification

Date: 2026-03-21

## Scope

This verification pass covered the current production-install path for shipping Superplan as one product:

- machine-level CLI install
- packaged overlay companion install metadata and artifact handling
- machine bootstrap of bundled skills
- machine-default overlay opt-in persistence
- overlay auto-launch when work first enters execution
- lifecycle update and cleanup behavior

## Automated Evidence

Commands run from the repo root:

```bash
npm test
npm --prefix apps/overlay-desktop run tauri:check
cargo test --manifest-path apps/overlay-desktop/src-tauri/Cargo.toml
npm run overlay:release
```

Observed evidence:

- `npm test` passed with installer coverage for:
  - CLI-only local source install
  - overlay companion install with machine-default enablement
  - overlay ensure cold-start launch
  - task-start auto-launch of the overlay companion
  - update preserving overlay install configuration
  - remove cleaning managed overlay artifacts
  - stable overlay release packaging outputs for macOS tarballs and Linux AppImage artifacts
- `tauri:check` validates the desktop app's Rust/Tauri shell after the launcher-facing workspace-targeting and single-instance changes
- `cargo test` validates the desktop app's Rust-side runtime resolution and launch-routing tests
- `npm run overlay:release` succeeded on the current macOS arm64 workspace and emitted `dist/release/overlay/superplan-overlay-darwin-arm64.tar.gz`

## Installer Contract

The current user-facing install flow is:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/superplan-md/superplan-plugin/dev/scripts/install.sh | sh
```

Current behavior:

- installs the CLI
- installs the packaged overlay companion for the current platform when the release artifact exists
- runs machine-level `superplan setup` automatically
- asks whether the overlay should be enabled by default on this machine
- when enabled, `superplan task new`, `superplan task batch`, `superplan run`, `superplan run <task_id>`, and `superplan task reopen` auto-reveal the overlay as work becomes visible

## Release Artifact Contract

Current stable artifact names:

- `superplan-overlay-darwin-arm64.tar.gz`
- `superplan-overlay-darwin-x64.tar.gz`
- `superplan-overlay-linux-arm64.AppImage`
- `superplan-overlay-linux-x64.AppImage`

Current release build command:

```bash
npm run overlay:release
```

Output directory:

```text
dist/release/overlay/
```

## Remaining Caveats

- The curl installer depends on packaged overlay release assets being published for the target ref and platform. Without those assets, the CLI still installs, but the one-product overlay experience cannot be delivered for that release channel.
- Native fullscreen-space behavior on macOS remains a separate shell acceptance gate. The install flow is wired, but fullscreen visibility still needs platform acceptance verification outside the packaging path.
